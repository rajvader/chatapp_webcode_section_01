    "description": "First China, then the United States — the German Chancellor is visiting the world’s two biggest power centers, aiming to secure maximum benefits for Germany’s economy and its geopolitical position.\nChina remains the key market for Germany, with bilateral trade surpassing €250 billion in 2025. Yet Chancellor Merz faces a challenge: German products are losing ground, and he needs to boost their appeal in a highly competitive Chinese market.\nNext stop: the United States, Germany’s second‑largest trading partner. But the long-standing transatlantic partnership has hit turbulence. President Trump’s tariff policies have strained relations, causing trade volumes to shrink by around 5 percent. So the big question is: Where should Germany place its bets? Is China the more promising partner — or do the US offer the stronger long‑term alliance? In this video, we explore Germany’s strategic dilemma between Washington and Beijing: Who is the better partner for the future?\n\nOur guests: Thorsten Benner, Global Public Policy Institute (GPPi)\nNoah Barkin, Rhodium Group \nMeredith Crowley, Professor of Economics University of Cambridge\n\nFor more news go to: http://www.dw.com/en/\n\nFollow DW on social media:\n►Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/dwnews\n►TikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@dwnews\n►Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/\n►Twitter: https://twitter.com/dwnews\n\nFür Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch\n\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1",
